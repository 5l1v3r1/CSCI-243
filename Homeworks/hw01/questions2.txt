8. Given the program files main.c, circle.h and circle.c:

    a.) What commands will compile the source files into object files?

        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
        gcc -c -std=c99 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic circle.c
        gcc -c -std=c99 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic main.c

    b.) What command will link the object files
        into an executable named broken?

        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
        gcc -o main main.o circle.o

    c.) Why does the program compile but fail to link?

        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
        The program fails to link because the 'compute' function in main.c calls function 'getArea' but the function 'getArea' was not implemented, although it was declared in the header file. This is due to a type in 'circle.c'. It implements the function 'getAreas', not 'getArea'.
