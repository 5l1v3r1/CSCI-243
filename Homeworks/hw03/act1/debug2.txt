Fix 1: The error occurs at line 144 and line 156.
The incorrect format string is provided to the printf function: life[row][col] is
of type char but the format string provided is "%s", which is for C-string. This leads
to a segmentation fault because the program tried to access an invalid memory address
that has the value of the ascii-code of the character at life[row][col].
The fix is changing the format string to "%c".
